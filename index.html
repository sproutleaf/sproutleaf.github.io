        <p> I was born and raised in a city that people longingly refer to as the Venice of the East. At the dawn of my
            birth, my grandfather gifted me miáo 苗 (sprout; a combination of wood and earth elements) and yè 烨 (shining
            brightly; a suggestion of fire), to balance out the water in our surroundings.</p>
        <p> I grew up aspiring to be a writer of poetry and fiction. In my childhood fantasy, I'd stay tucked away in a
            forever home in the Chinese countryside, weaving metaphors and narratives the same way my ancestors braided
            cotton and linen. 烟火人间，家常便饭; a life of slowness and ease.</p>
        <p>How did I end up here then? Traversing borders, floating in the ether, speaking the colonizers' language; the
            syllables of my mother
            tongue had long lost their nuances and fullness. Chance, whims, stubbornness... I will not bore you
            with the details. What matters is I inadvertantly became mired in technology and built a life around it.</p>
        <p>
            You can find me at the following places, metabolizing what I consume and experience:
